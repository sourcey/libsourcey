[AsyncQueue](#asyncqueue) is a thread-based queue which receives packets from any thread source and dispatches them asynchronously.

This queue is useful for deferring load from operation critical system devices before performing long running tasks.

The thread will call the [RunnableQueue](#runnablequeue)'s [run()](#classicy_1_1RunnableQueue_1a23ae7b15a81f939ea603d123d9aec2d5) method to constantly flush outgoing packets until [cancel()](#classicy_1_1AsyncQueue_1a23b99d0d77fb154c027fa717e7949840) is called.

{#timer}

#### Timer

```cpp
Timer(uv::Loop * loop)
```

Create a timer without a timeout or interval; values must be set before `[start()](#classicy_1_1Timer_1a59e3275d17107212520b362cbf0cb3d5)`.

#### Parameters
* `loop` Event loop to associate with. Defaults to the process-wide default loop.

---

{#timer}

#### Timer

```cpp
Timer(std::int64_t timeout, uv::Loop * loop, std::function< void()> func)
```

Create a one-shot timer that fires after `timeout` milliseconds.

If `func` is provided the timer starts immediately; otherwise call `[start()](#classicy_1_1Timer_1a59e3275d17107212520b362cbf0cb3d5)` manually.

#### Parameters
* `timeout` Delay in milliseconds before the first (and only) fire. 

* `loop` Event loop to associate with. 

* `func` Optional callback connected to the `[Timeout](#timeout)` signal and used to start the timer immediately.

---

{#timer}

#### Timer

```cpp
Timer(std::int64_t timeout, std::int64_t interval, uv::Loop * loop, std::function< void()> func)
```

Create a repeating timer with an initial delay and a repeat period.

Fires once after `timeout` milliseconds, then repeatedly every `interval` milliseconds. If `func` is provided the timer starts immediately; otherwise call `[start()](#classicy_1_1Timer_1a59e3275d17107212520b362cbf0cb3d5)` manually.

#### Parameters
* `timeout` Initial delay in milliseconds. 

* `interval` Repeat period in milliseconds. 

* `loop` Event loop to associate with. 

* `func` Optional callback connected to the `[Timeout](#timeout)` signal and used to start the timer immediately.

---

{#timer}

#### ~Timer

`virtual`

```cpp
virtual ~Timer()
```

Destructor.

---

{#start}

#### start

```cpp
void start()
```

Start the timer using the previously configured timeout and interval.

Throws `std::logic_error` if neither a timeout nor an interval has been set, or if the handle has not been allocated. Has no effect if already active.

---

{#start}

#### start

`virtual`

```cpp
virtual void start(std::function< void()> func)
```

Connect `func` to the `[Timeout](#timeout)` signal and start the timer.

#### Parameters
* `func` Callback invoked on each timeout event.

---

{#stop}

#### stop

```cpp
void stop()
```

Stop the timer. Resets the fire count to zero.

Has no effect if the timer is not active.

---

{#restart}

#### restart

```cpp
void restart()
```

Restart the timer.

If the timer is not currently active, behaves like `[start()](#classicy_1_1Timer_1a59e3275d17107212520b362cbf0cb3d5)`. If it is active, calls `[again()](#classicy_1_1Timer_1a1479aec7fadd9fdc71a41ed6a51af1c8)` to reset the countdown using the repeat value. A timeout or interval must be set beforehand, otherwise `[start()](#classicy_1_1Timer_1a59e3275d17107212520b362cbf0cb3d5)` will throw `std::logic_error`.

---

{#again}

#### again

```cpp
void again()
```

Reset the countdown without stopping and restarting the timer.

For repeating timers this restarts the repeat interval from now. For non-repeating timers this has the same effect as stopping the timer. Throws on error if `uv_timer_again` fails (e.g. the timer was never started). Resets the fire count to zero.

---

{#settimeout}

#### setTimeout

```cpp
void setTimeout(std::int64_t timeout)
```

Set the initial delay before the first timeout event.

Has no effect if the timer is currently active.

#### Parameters
* `timeout` Delay in milliseconds.

---

{#setinterval}

#### setInterval

```cpp
void setInterval(std::int64_t interval)
```

Set the repeat interval (calls `uv_timer_set_repeat`).

Takes effect from the next timeout event. If set from within a timer callback on a repeating timer, the new value is used from the following iteration; on a non-repeating timer the timer will have already stopped.

#### Parameters
* `interval` Repeat period in milliseconds; 0 disables repeating.

---

{#active}

#### active

`const`

```cpp
bool active() const
```

#### Returns
`true` if the timer is currently counting down.

---

{#timeout}

#### timeout

`const`

```cpp
std::int64_t timeout() const
```

#### Returns
The configured initial timeout in milliseconds.

---

```

#### Returns
The effective repeat interval reported by libuv, in milliseconds.

---

{#count}

#### count

```cpp
std::int64_t count()
```

#### Returns
The number of times the timer has fired since the last start or [again()](#classicy_1_1Timer_1a1479aec7fadd9fdc71a41ed6a51af1c8).

---

{#handle}

#### handle

```cpp
uv::Handle< uv_timer_t > & handle()
```

#### Returns
Reference to the underlying `uv_timer_t` handle wrapper.

---

{#async}

#### async

`virtual` `const`

```cpp
virtual bool async() const
```

#### Returns
`false`; the timer is event-loop-driven, not thread-based.

Base class for intrusive reference counting.

Embeds the refcount in the object itself - no separate control block allocation, no atomic operations. Safe for single-threaded libuv loops.

Usage: inherit from RefCounted<YourClass>, then use IntrusivePtr<YourClass> instead of std::shared_ptr<YourClass>.

```

> **Subclassed by:** [`Idler`](#idler), [`Synchronizer`](#synchronizer), [`Thread`](#thread), [`Timer`](#timer)

[Runner](#runner) is a virtual interface for implementing asynchronous objects such as threads and futures.

### Public Methods

| Return | Name | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
|  | [`Runner`](#runner)  |  |
| `void` | [`start`](#start)  | Starts the asynchronous context with the given callback. The callback must remain valid for the lifetime of the `[Runner](#runner)`. |
| `bool` | [`running`](#running) `const` | Returns true if the async context is currently running. |
| `void` | [`cancel`](#cancel)  | Signals the async context to stop at the earliest opportunity. |
| `bool` | [`cancelled`](#cancelled) `const` | Returns true if the context has been cancelled. The implementation is responsible for exiting as soon as possible after cancellation. |
| `bool` | [`repeating`](#repeating) `const` | Returns true if the runner is in repeating mode. |
| `void` | [`setRepeating`](#setrepeating)  | Enables or disables repeating mode. When repeating, the target function is invoked repeatedly until `[cancel()](#classicy_1_1Runner_1a53b3794fbd4ace235771a4e84f93f1e7)` is called. This normalizes behaviour across thread-based and event-loop-based `[Runner](#runner)` implementations. Must be called before `[start()](#classicy_1_1Runner_1a5969e823f1ce0bdd8730d3108bf13fbd)`. |
| `bool` | [`async`](#async) `const` | Returns true if the implementation is thread-based. |
| `std::thread::id` | [`tid`](#tid) `const` | Returns the native thread ID of the thread running the async context. |
| `bool` | [`waitForExit`](#waitforexit)  | Blocks until the async context exits or the timeout elapses. The context should be cancelled before calling this method. Must be called from outside the runner's own thread to avoid deadlock. |

{#attach}

#### attach

`const` `inline`

```cpp
inline int attach(Function const & func, void * instance, int id, int priority) const
```

Connects a `lambda` or `std::function` to the signal.

#### Parameters
* `func` The callable to invoke when the signal is emitted. 

* `instance` Optional owner pointer used for instance-based detach; pass `nullptr` if not applicable. 

* `id` Explicit slot ID to assign; pass `-1` to auto-assign. 

* `priority` Higher values are called first; pass `-1` for default ordering. 

#### Returns
The assigned slot ID, which can be passed to `[detach()](#classicy_1_1Signal_3_01RT_07Args_8_8_8_08_00_01MutexT_01_4_1af559f1f6b044f249b3d7b04d80274bab)` to disconnect.

---

{#attach}

#### attach

`const` `inline`

```cpp
inline int attach(SlotPtr slot) const
```

Connects a pre-constructed `SlotPtr` to the signal.

Duplicate slots (matched by delegate equality) are removed before insertion. Slots are kept sorted in descending priority order after insertion.

#### Parameters
* `slot` The slot to attach. Must have a valid delegate. 

#### Returns
The assigned slot ID, which can be passed to `[detach()](#classicy_1_1Signal_3_01RT_07Args_8_8_8_08_00_01MutexT_01_4_1af559f1f6b044f249b3d7b04d80274bab)` to disconnect. 

#### Exceptions
* `std::logic_error` if `slot->id` is set explicitly and already in use.

---

{#detach}

#### detach

`const` `inline`

```cpp
inline bool detach(int id) const
```

Detaches the slot with the given ID.

Safe to call from within a slot's callback (the slot is marked dead before erasure).

#### Parameters
* `id` The slot ID returned by `[attach()](#classicy_1_1Signal_3_01RT_07Args_8_8_8_08_00_01MutexT_01_4_1ab117b8aacf13226bade149c94b6088ed)`. 

#### Returns
`true` if a slot was found and removed; `false` if the ID was not found.

---

{#detach}

#### detach

`const` `inline`

```cpp
inline bool detach(const void * instance) const
```

Detaches all slots associated with the given instance pointer.

Useful for bulk disconnect when an object is destroyed. Matches slots by their stored `instance` pointer, not by delegate equality.

#### Parameters
* `instance` The owner pointer used when the slots were attached. 

#### Returns
`true` if at least one slot was removed; `false` otherwise.

---

{#detach}

#### detach

`const` `inline`

```cpp
inline bool detach(SlotPtr other) const
```

Detaches the slot whose delegate compares equal to `other->delegate`.

Used by the `[slot()](#slot)` helper overloads and `operator-=` to disconnect a specific class-member or function binding by value.

#### Parameters
* `other` A slot whose delegate is compared against attached slots. 

#### Returns
`true` if a matching slot was found and removed; `false` otherwise.

---

{#detachall}

#### detachAll

`const` `inline`

```cpp
inline void detachAll() const
```

Detaches and destroys all currently attached slots.

Each slot is marked dead before removal. After this call `[nslots()](#classicy_1_1Signal_3_01RT_07Args_8_8_8_08_00_01MutexT_01_4_1ab987050a876fe4e983601eae08062587)` returns 0.

---

{#emit}

#### emit

`virtual` `inline`

```cpp
virtual inline RT emit(Args... args)
```

Emits the signal, invoking all live attached slots in priority order.

For `[Signal](#signal)<bool(...)>`: iterates slots and returns `true` as soon as any slot returns `true`, stopping further propagation. Returns `false` if no slot handled the event.

For `[Signal](#signal)<void(...)>`: calls every live slot unconditionally.

Emission snapshots raw slot pointers under a shared lock, then invokes delegates without holding the lock. Dead slots are swept after the outermost emission returns, allowing attach/detach inside callbacks without copying `shared_ptr`s on the hot path.

#### Parameters
* `args` Arguments forwarded to each connected slot. 

#### Returns
For `bool` return type: `true` if any slot handled the event, `false` otherwise. For `void` return type: nothing.

---

{#slots}

#### slots

`const` `inline`

```cpp
inline std::vector< SlotPtr > slots() const
```

Returns a snapshot copy of the current slot list.

The copy is taken under a shared lock, so it is safe to call concurrently with attach/detach operations. Only currently live slots are returned.

#### Returns
A vector of `SlotPtr` representing all currently registered slots.

---

{#nslots}

#### nslots

`const` `inline`

```cpp
inline size_t nslots() const
```

Returns the number of slots currently registered with this signal.

The count is taken under a shared lock. Slots that were concurrently killed but not yet erased may still be included in the count.

#### Returns
The number of entries in the internal slot list.

---

{#operator}

#### operator+=

`inline`

```cpp
inline int operator+=(Function const & func)
```

Attaches a function; equivalent to `attach(func)`.

#### Returns
Assigned slot ID.

---

```

Destroy the stream, stopping reads and freeing pooled write requests.

---

{#close}

#### close

`virtual` `inline`

```cpp
virtual inline void close()
```

Closes and resets the stream handle. This will close the active socket/pipe and destroy the handle.

If the stream is already closed this call will have no side-effects.

---

{#shutdown}

#### shutdown

`inline`

```cpp
inline bool shutdown()
```

Send a TCP/pipe shutdown request to the connected peer.

Issues a half-close: no further writes will be accepted after this, but the stream remains open for reading until the peer also closes.

#### Returns
`true` if the shutdown request was submitted successfully; `false` if the stream is not active.

---

{#write}

#### write

`inline`

```cpp
inline bool write(const char * data, size_t len)

The write is non-blocking; data is buffered by libuv. Returns `false` without throwing if the stream is inactive, reads have not started, or the internal write queue exceeds the high-water mark.

#### Parameters
* `data` Pointer to the bytes to send. Must remain valid until the write completion callback fires. 

* `len` Number of bytes to send. 

#### Returns
`true` if the write was queued; `false` on backpressure or if the stream is not in a writable state.

---

{#writeowned}

#### writeOwned

`inline`

```cpp
inline bool writeOwned(Buffer && buffer)
```

Write an owned payload buffer to the stream.

The buffer is moved into the queued write request and retained until the libuv completion callback fires. Use this path whenever the caller does not naturally own storage beyond the current stack frame.

#### write

`inline`

```cpp
inline bool write(const char * data, size_t len, uv_stream_t * send)
```

Write `len` bytes from `data` together with a stream handle over an IPC pipe (uses `uv_write2`).

Only valid for named-pipe handles opened with IPC mode enabled. Throws `std::logic_error` if called on a non-IPC pipe.

#### Parameters
* `data` Bytes to send alongside the handle. 

* `len` Number of bytes to send. 

* `send` [Stream](#stream) handle to pass to the receiving process. 

#### Returns
`true` if the write was queued; `false` on error.

---

{#stream}

#### stream

`inline`

```cpp
inline uv_stream_t * stream()
```

Return the underlying `uv_stream_t` pointer cast from the native handle.

{#datetime}

## DateTime

```cpp
#include <icy/datetime.h>
```

This class represents an instant in time, expressed in years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds based on the Gregorian calendar. The class is mainly useful for conversions between UTC, Julian day and Gregorian calendar dates.

The date and time stored in a [DateTime](#datetime) is always in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) and thus independent of the timezone in effect on the system.

Conversion calculations are based on algorithms collected and described by Peter Baum at [http://vsg.cape.com/~pbaum/date/date0.htm](http://vsg.cape.com/~pbaum/date/date0.htm)

Internally, this class stores a date/time in two forms (UTC and broken down) for performance reasons. Only use this class for conversions between date/time representations. Use the [Timestamp](#timestamp) class for everything else.

Notes:

* Zero is a valid year (in accordance with ISO 8601 and astronomical year numbering)

* Year zero (0) is a leap year

* Negative years (years preceding 1 BC) are not supported

{#localdatetime}

## LocalDateTime

```cpp
#include <icy/datetime.h>
```

This class represents an instant in local time (as opposed to UTC), expressed in years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds based on the Gregorian calendar.

In addition to the date and time, the class also maintains a time zone differential, which denotes the difference in seconds from UTC to local time, i.e. UTC = local time - time zone differential.

Although [LocalDateTime](#localdatetime) supports relational and arithmetic operators, all date/time comparisons and date/time arithmetics should be done in UTC, using the [DateTime](#datetime) or [Timestamp](#timestamp) class for better performance. The relational operators normalize the dates/times involved to UTC before carrying out the comparison.

The time zone differential is based on the input date and time and current time zone. A number of constructors accept an explicit time zone differential parameter. These should not be used since daylight savings time processing is impossible since the time zone is unknown. Each of the constructors accepting a tzd parameter have been marked as deprecated and may be removed in a future revision.

{#datetimeparser}

## DateTimeParser

```cpp
#include <icy/datetime.h>
```

This class provides a method for parsing dates and times from strings. All parsing methods do their best to parse a meaningful result, even from malformed input strings.

The returned [DateTime](#datetime) will always contain a time in the same timezone as the time in the string. Call [DateTime::makeUTC()](#classicy_1_1DateTime_1afb1c31f9f9242ed9987d4c2481579ade) with the timeZoneDifferential returned by [parse()](#classicy_1_1DateTimeParser_1afaf62f609110897d879ec98f45c9752f) to convert the [DateTime](#datetime) to UTC.

Note: When parsing a time in 12-hour (AM/PM) format, the hour (h) must be parsed before the AM/PM designator (a, A), otherwise the AM/PM designator will be ignored.

See the [DateTimeFormatter](#datetimeformatter) class for a list of supported format specifiers. In addition to the format specifiers supported by [DateTimeFormatter](#datetimeformatter), an additional specifier is supported: r will parse a year given by either two or four digits. Years 69-00 are interpreted in the 20th century (1969-2000), years 01-68 in the 21th century (2001-2068).

{#packetstream}

## PacketStream

```cpp
#include <icy/packetstream.h>
```

> **Inherits:** [`Stateful< PacketStreamState >`](#stateful)

Processes and broadcasts IPackets through a configurable adapter graph.

A [PacketStream](#packetstream) consists of one or many PacketSources, one or many PacketProcessors, and one or many delegate receivers.

This class enables the developer to setup a processor chain in order to perform arbitrary processing on data packets using interchangeable packet adapters, and pump the output to any delegate function or even another [PacketStream](#packetstream).

Note that [PacketStream](#packetstream) itself inherits from [PacketStreamAdapter](#packetstreamadapter), so a [PacketStream](#packetstream) can be the source of another [PacketStream](#packetstream).

All [PacketStream](#packetstream) methods are thread-safe, but once the stream is running you will not be able to attach or detach stream adapters.

In order to synchronize output packets with the application event loop take a look at the [SyncPacketQueue](#syncpacketqueue) class. For lengthy operations you can add an [AsyncPacketQueue](#asyncpacketqueue) to the start of the stream to defer processing from the PacketSource thread.

| `bool` | [`stopped`](#stopped) `virtual` `const` | Returns true when the stream is in the Stopping or Stopped state. |
| `bool` | [`closed`](#closed) `virtual` `const` | Returns true when the stream is in the Closed or [Error](#error) state. |
| `bool` | [`lock`](#lock) `virtual` | Sets the stream to locked state. In a locked state no new adapters can be added or removed from the stream until the stream is stopped. |
| `bool` | [`locked`](#locked) `virtual` `const` | Returns true is the stream is currently locked. |
| `void` | [`write`](#write) `virtual` | Write a mutable buffer into the stream without copying. The caller must keep the buffer alive until processing crosses a Cloned/Retained boundary or, if the graph is fully synchronous, until [write()](#classicy_1_1PacketStream_1a22f83c8eda142efab8d21ea04a88137a) returns. |
| `void` | [`write`](#write) `virtual` | Write a read-only buffer into the stream; data is copied immediately into an owning [RawPacket](#rawpacket) before any adapter sees it. |
| `void` | [`write`](#write) `virtual` | Write a packet directly into the processing chain. |
| `void` | [`attachSource`](#attachsource) `virtual` | Attach a bare packet signal as a stream source. The signal is wrapped in an unowned [PacketStreamAdapter](#packetstreamadapter) internally.

| `void` | [`attachSource`](#attachsource) `virtual` | Attach a [PacketStreamAdapter](#packetstreamadapter) as a source. Source adapters default to Borrowed retention unless overridden; they must not retain inbound packet storage asynchronously without reporting Cloned or Retained. |
| `void` | [`attachSource`](#attachsource) `inline` | Attach a shared_ptr-managed source adapter to the stream. The stream shares ownership; the adapter is kept alive at least until teardown. Throws std::runtime_error if `ptr` does not derive from [PacketStreamAdapter](#packetstreamadapter). |

Pass order = -1 to append at the end of the current processor list. Valid range is -1 to 101; values outside this range throw std::invalid_argument. Borrowed processors must finish with the packet before [process()](#classicy_1_1PacketStream_1ad5a93a94d2b8694b517438935c435397) returns. Queue/processors that defer work must report Cloned or Retained via retention() so upstream code has an explicit ownership boundary. |
| `void` | [`attach`](#attach) `inline` | Attach a shared_ptr-managed processor to the stream. The stream shares ownership; the processor is kept alive at least until teardown. Throws std::runtime_error if `ptr` does not derive from [PacketProcessor](#packetprocessor). |

| `void` | [`synchronizeOutput`](#synchronizeoutput) `virtual` | Synchronize stream output packets with a libuv event loop. Internally attaches a [SyncPacketQueue](#syncpacketqueue) at order 101 so that all packets emitted by the processor chain are dispatched from the loop thread rather than the source thread. Must be called before [start()](#classicy_1_1PacketStream_1ac6843f20698879acdaabd8110b440c55). |
| `void` | [`autoStart`](#autostart) `virtual` | Enable or disable auto-start behaviour (default: false).

This class inherits the `[Runner](#runner)` interface and may be used with any implementation that's powered by an asynchronous `[Runner](#runner)`.

### Public Methods

| Return | Name | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
|  | [`Synchronizer`](#synchronizer)  | Creates a synchronizer attached to the given event loop without a callback. Call `[start()](#classicy_1_1Synchronizer_1a535a1605fc8902d814f9f5ab5e213a66)` separately to register the callback before using `[post()](#classicy_1_1Synchronizer_1a1400f8a4c294ba3d4a9d9d1887131abb)`. |
|  | [`Synchronizer`](#synchronizer)  | Creates and immediately starts a synchronizer with a single callback function. The target is invoked from the event loop context each time `[post()](#classicy_1_1Synchronizer_1a1400f8a4c294ba3d4a9d9d1887131abb)` is called. |
|  | [`Synchronizer`](#synchronizer) `inline` `explicit` | Creates and immediately starts a synchronizer with a variadic callback. |
|  | [`~Synchronizer`](#synchronizer) `virtual` | Destructor. |
| `void` | [`post`](#post)  | Send a synchronization request to the event loop. Call this each time you want the target method called synchronously. The synchronous method will be called on next iteration. This is not atomic, so do not expect a callback for every request. |
| `void` | [`start`](#start) `inline` | Starts the synchronizer with a variadic callback function. The callback is invoked from the event loop each time `[post()](#classicy_1_1Synchronizer_1a1400f8a4c294ba3d4a9d9d1887131abb)` is called. Throws `std::logic_error` if already running or if the handle is null. |
| `void` | [`start`](#start) `virtual` | Starts the synchronizer with a `std::function` callback. Overrides `[Runner::start](#classicy_1_1Runner_1a5969e823f1ce0bdd8730d3108bf13fbd)`; delegates to the variadic `start` template. |
| `void` | [`cancel`](#cancel) `virtual` | Cancels the synchronizer, signalling the associated callback to stop. A subsequent `[post()](#classicy_1_1Synchronizer_1a1400f8a4c294ba3d4a9d9d1887131abb)` is needed to wake up the event loop so it can process the cancellation. |
| `void` | [`close`](#close) `virtual` | Cancels the synchronizer and closes the underlying `uv_async_t` handle. Safe to call multiple times; no-op if already closed. |
| `uv::Handle< uv_async_t > &` | [`handle`](#handle)  | Returns a reference to the underlying libuv async handle. |

---

{#synchronizer}

#### Synchronizer

```cpp
Synchronizer(uv::Loop * loop)

Creates a synchronizer attached to the given event loop without a callback. Call `[start()](#classicy_1_1Synchronizer_1a535a1605fc8902d814f9f5ab5e213a66)` separately to register the callback before using `[post()](#classicy_1_1Synchronizer_1a1400f8a4c294ba3d4a9d9d1887131abb)`. 
#### Parameters
* `loop` Event loop to attach the async handle to.

---

{#synchronizer}

#### Synchronizer

```cpp
Synchronizer(std::function< void()> target, uv::Loop * loop)
```

Creates and immediately starts a synchronizer with a single callback function. The target is invoked from the event loop context each time `[post()](#classicy_1_1Synchronizer_1a1400f8a4c294ba3d4a9d9d1887131abb)` is called. 
#### Parameters
* `target` Callback to invoke on each event loop wakeup. 

* `loop` Event loop to attach the async handle to.

---

{#synchronizer}

#### Synchronizer

`inline` `explicit`

```cpp
template<typename Function, typename... Args> inline explicit Synchronizer(Function && func, Args &&... args, uv::Loop * loop)
```

Creates and immediately starts a synchronizer with a variadic callback. 
#### Parameters
* `Function` Callable type. 

* `Args` Argument types forwarded to the function. 

#### Parameters
* `func` Callable to invoke on each event loop wakeup. 

* `args` Arguments forwarded to `func`. 

* `loop` Event loop to attach the async handle to.

---

{#synchronizer}

#### ~Synchronizer

`virtual`

```cpp
virtual ~Synchronizer()
```

Destructor.

---

{#post}

#### post

```cpp
void post()
```

Send a synchronization request to the event loop. Call this each time you want the target method called synchronously. The synchronous method will be called on next iteration. This is not atomic, so do not expect a callback for every request.

---

{#start}

#### start

`inline`

```cpp
template<typename Function, typename... Args> inline void start(Function && func, Args &&... args)
```

Starts the synchronizer with a variadic callback function. The callback is invoked from the event loop each time `[post()](#classicy_1_1Synchronizer_1a1400f8a4c294ba3d4a9d9d1887131abb)` is called. Throws `std::logic_error` if already running or if the handle is null. 
#### Parameters
* `Function` Callable type. 

* `Args` Argument types forwarded to the function. 

#### Parameters
* `func` Callable to invoke on each event loop wakeup. 

* `args` Arguments forwarded to `func`.

---

{#start}

#### start

`virtual`

```cpp
virtual void start(std::function< void()> func)
```

Starts the synchronizer with a `std::function` callback. Overrides `[Runner::start](#classicy_1_1Runner_1a5969e823f1ce0bdd8730d3108bf13fbd)`; delegates to the variadic `start` template. 
#### Parameters
* `func` Callback invoked from the event loop on each `[post()](#classicy_1_1Synchronizer_1a1400f8a4c294ba3d4a9d9d1887131abb)` call.

---

{#cancel}

#### cancel

`virtual`

```cpp
virtual void cancel()
```

Cancels the synchronizer, signalling the associated callback to stop. A subsequent `[post()](#classicy_1_1Synchronizer_1a1400f8a4c294ba3d4a9d9d1887131abb)` is needed to wake up the event loop so it can process the cancellation.

---

{#close}

#### close

`virtual`

```cpp
virtual void close()
```

Cancels the synchronizer and closes the underlying `uv_async_t` handle. Safe to call multiple times; no-op if already closed.

---

{#handle}

#### handle

```cpp
uv::Handle< uv_async_t > & handle()
```

Returns a reference to the underlying libuv async handle. 
#### Returns
Reference to the `[uv::Handle](uv.md#handle-2)<uv_async_t>`.

> **Subclassed by:** [`Transaction< Message >`](net.md#transaction), [`Transaction< PacketT >`](net.md#transaction)

Request/response transaction with timeout and retry logic.

Lifetime is managed by [IntrusivePtr](#intrusiveptr) via the [RefCounted](#refcounted) base class. The transaction is kept alive as long as at least one [IntrusivePtr](#intrusiveptr) references it. The owning client holds a Ptr in its transaction list; callbacks should capture a Ptr copy to prevent premature deletion.

When a terminal state (Success or Failed) is reached, the transaction cleans up its timer but does NOT delete itself. The [IntrusivePtr](#intrusiveptr) destructor handles deletion when the last reference is released.
