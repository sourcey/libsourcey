# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Removed

- Removed the unused `Base64PacketEncoder` packet-stream adapter and its public header. Use the `icy::base64` namespace helpers directly for Base64 encoding and decoding.

## [2.4.10] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- `ICapture::start`/`::stop` (which override `basic::Startable`) and `MediaCapture::emit` (which overrides `PacketSource::emit`) are now declared with `override`. clang-18 with `-Werror -Winconsistent-missing-override` was failing the bench build on these.
- `[[nodiscard]]` returns from `AudioEncoder::encode`, `VideoEncoder::encode`, `MultiplexEncoder::encode{Video,Audio}`, and `VideoEncoder::flush` are now explicitly discarded with `(void)` at the seven call sites in `audiopacketencoder.cpp`, `multiplexpacketencoder.cpp`, `videoencoder.cpp`, and `videopacketencoder.cpp`. Emission happens through the encoder's emitter, not through the boolean return; the discard was always intentional.

### Changed

- The CI benchmarks job now runs under clang-18 instead of gcc-14. The gcc-14 build of the bench binaries hit SIGILL on the GitHub-hosted ubuntu-24.04 runner under `-O3`; the library itself builds and tests cleanly under gcc-14 in the regular Linux job and under all three sanitizer jobs. Tracked by [nilstate/icey#325](https://github.com/nilstate/icey/issues/325). `icy_add_benchmark` carries a `-O2 -fno-tree-vectorize` GCC fallback as defence in depth for anyone building bench binaries with GCC outside CI.
- Doc cross-links to the removed `docs/build/*` pages now redirect to the `recipes/http-server` recipe, the README quick-start, and `docs/run/install`. `sourcey.config.ts`, `release-sync.sh`, and `release-check.sh` no longer iterate over the deleted files.

## [2.4.9] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- `wrtc::codec_registry::hasEncoder` now does a runtime probe (`avcodec_alloc_context3` + `avcodec_open2`), with results cached. The prior implementation only checked `avcodec_find_encoder_by_name`, which on Linux distros that ship libavcodec with hardware-encoder wrappers built in (h264_nvenc, h264_vaapi, h264_qsv) returned true even when the runtime resources for those encoders (CUDA, VA-API drivers, etc.) were absent. The h264-on-macOS / videotoolbox path was unaffected; the fix prevents codec selection from picking a hardware encoder that exists at link time but cannot be opened at runtime, which surfaced as "Cannot open the video codec: Operation not permitted" in the icey-cli browser smoke on Linux CI.

## [2.4.8] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- `http::Server` portability: replaced `file_clock::to_sys` with the standard delta-calibration idiom (`system_clock::now() + (fileTime - file_clock::now())`). MSVC's `_File_time_clock` does not expose `to_sys`, so the prior libc++-targeted fix from 2.4.6 broke the Windows build. The new form works on libstdc++, libc++, and MSVC, and tolerates the precision difference between libc++ and libstdc++ that the prior `time_point_cast` was meant to address.
- `parseDeviceUrl`: device-resolution path is now guarded by `HAVE_FFMPEG_AVDEVICE`. The 2.4.7 implementation called `avdevice_register_all` unconditionally, breaking builds where libavdevice is not linked. Without it, hitting a recognised device URL throws an explicit "libavdevice is not linked" error rather than failing to build.

### Changed

- Doc cleanup: cross-links to the removed `docs/build/*` pages are redirected to the `recipes/http-server` recipe, the README quick-start, and `docs/run/install`. `sourcey.config.ts`, `release-sync.sh`, and `release-check.sh` no longer iterate over the deleted files.

## [2.4.7] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- `icy::av::parseDeviceUrl(source)` — single source of truth for libavdevice URL schemes (`avfoundation:`, `v4l2:`, `dshow:`). Returns the resolved `AVInputFormat*` and the post-prefix filename. Throws if a recognised scheme has no matching backend on this build.
- `MediaCapture::openFile` routes recognised device URLs through the existing `openStream(filename, iformat, opts)` path, so callers can open the OS camera directly without an ffmpeg/relay subprocess.

### Fixed

- `internal::init()` now calls `avdevice_register_all()` under `HAVE_FFMPEG_AVDEVICE`. The prior comment was wrong: codec/format auto-registration arrived in FFmpeg 4.0+, but libavdevice still requires an explicit register call for `av_find_input_format("avfoundation"|"v4l2"|"dshow")` to resolve. `parseDeviceUrl` also performs a one-shot `std::call_once` registration so device URLs work even before any `MediaCapture` is constructed.
- `MediaCapture::run` no longer treats `AVERROR(EAGAIN)` from `av_read_frame` as fatal. Live demuxers (notably avfoundation) return it whenever their internal frame queue is momentarily empty; the prior code tore the capture down at the first hiccup, which surfaced as the capture pipeline emitting only the initial three buffered frames before going silent.

### Changed

- Bumped the pinned `libdatachannel` from `v0.24.1` to `v0.24.2`.

## [2.4.6] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- `http::Server` now compiles on macOS libc++ where `file_clock::to_sys` returns a different precision than libstdc++ on Linux. Wrapped in `time_point_cast<system_clock::duration>` so both stdlibs produce a `system_clock::time_point` cleanly.
- `AudioPacketEncoder::onStreamStateChange` now calls `AudioEncoder::open()` after `create()` so the resampler is built when input format differs from the encoder's expected format. Without it, AAC's planar `fltp` was being written to opus's interleaved `flt` FIFO, producing garbled audio with mis-interleaved channels.
- `AudioEncoder::flushBuffer` no longer increments output PTS by 1 per frame. PTS is now anchored to the first input packet's PTS and advances by `frame->nb_samples` per encoded frame, matching the standard pattern that libopus and other audio encoders expect. Eliminates the `[libopus] Queue input is backward in time` flood.

### Added

- `MediaCapture::setOpenOptions(map<string, string>)` for passing libavformat AVOptions (`rtsp_transport`, `fflags`, `analyzeduration`, `probesize`, `low_delay`, `reorder_queue_size`, ...) at `openFile()` time. Used by callers handling live network sources that need low-latency hints.

## [2.4.5] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed

- System-dependency builds no longer vendor and install `nlohmann/json.hpp`, avoiding conflicts with downstream package managers that already provide `nlohmann-json`
- Exported CMake package configs now propagate the `nlohmann_json` dependency when system deps are enabled

## [2.4.4] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- Realtime intelligence pipeline primitives in the `vision` module, including frame normalization for detector-ready frames
- WebRTC receive jitter buffer for smoother inbound media playback
- API reference docs for graft, speech, and vision modules
- Markdown sanitization script for generated API docs
- Permanent macOS system-deps + FFmpeg CI coverage matching downstream package-manager builds

### Changed

- Doxygen config updated for new module coverage
- Docs now use latest sourcey toolchain
- Module guide updated with graft, speech, vision entries

### Removed

- pluga module and docs (replaced by graft)

### Fixed

- Apple AVFoundation source compatibility for package-manager builds on modern macOS SDKs
- Darwin shared-library symbols are preserved for downstream package-manager builds

## [2.4.3] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed

- Downstream package-manager builds now resolve `libuv` correctly when the system dependency is exported as a shared target instead of a static-only alias
- RPM source-package staging now carries the downstream compatibility patch set and claims the installed umbrella and vendored JSON headers in the development package
- MacPorts builds now force the supported `Release` CMake build type instead of inheriting the unsupported default from the port group
- The GitHub release workflow now validates the pre-finalize tag state, so tagged releases can publish before `make release-finalize` pins the archive hashes on `main`

## [2.4.2] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed

- Package-manager builds now accept the shared `libuv::uv` target exported by `vcpkg` and other system package layouts
- Windows consumers no longer rely on backported export/linkage fixes for `Timeout`, `PacketFactory`, `Transaction`, and the base `uv` wrapper templates
- FFmpeg-backed builds now propagate discovered library search directories so Windows link steps can resolve `avcodec.lib` and related FFmpeg libraries

## [2.4.1] - 2026-03-30

### Changed

- Release tooling now treats Conan like the rest of the package-manager surfaces:
  - `make release` seeds `packaging/conan/conandata.yml`
  - `make release-finalize` pins the tagged archive hash and runs the final consistency check
- The documented release flow is now explicit about the post-tag finalize step instead of suggesting a pre-tag `release-check` that could only fail on placeholder hashes

### Fixed

- Alpine system-package builds now accept the shared `llhttp` targets exported by Alpine's `llhttp-dev` package instead of hard-linking `llhttp_static`
- The local Conan recipe now builds from immutable tagged GitHub archives instead of exporting a live checkout into the package

## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added

- Repo-local package manager layouts under `packaging/` with `make package-conan` and `make package-vcpkg` entry points for local consumer validation
- Homebrew tap formulae, Debian / PPA source-package scaffolding, and release hooks for those package surfaces
- Browser smoke coverage for the `src/webrtc/apps/media-server/web/` frontend and media-server interop path
- Reportable microbenchmark runner plus focused parse/probe benches for packet stream, HTTP, WebSocket, and STUN hot paths
- Focused `webrtcbench` and `symplebench` targets covering:
  - WebRTC sender dispatch
  - WebRTC receiver dispatch
  - Symple room fanout
  - Symple client parse/dispatch
- API overview quality checks in the docs toolchain to catch shallow or missing generated reference summaries
- Internal Symple protocol/state helpers for welcome parsing, sanitized presence emission, room reconciliation, and roster presence application, backed by focused unit coverage
- `webrtc_support` as a dedicated support library for Symple/WebSocket signallers, including the server-side virtual-peer adapter now used by samples and `media-server`

### Changed

- WebRTC browser/media-server behavior after 2.3.0: codec negotiation is tighter, browser offer handling is stricter, and `PeerSession` / track flow is more defensive under real browser traffic
- Public package, docs, and sample surface now use lowercase `icey` consistently, with no retained `Icey` CMake/package-manager naming
- Public lifecycle verbs are now standardized on `start()` / `stop()` across HTTP client/server, Symple client/server, and TURN client surfaces; the previous spellings were removed instead of being kept as compatibility aliases
- WebRTC internals are now cut along explicit seams instead of monolithic translation units:
  - `PeerSession` state/signalling/RTC work is split across `peersession.cpp`, `peersessionsignalling.cpp`, and `peersessionrtc.cpp`
  - remote answer scoping lives in `remotemediaplan.cpp`
  - codec support is centralized in `codecregistry.cpp`
  - `media-server` runtime code is split under `apps/media-server/internal/`
- Public Symple and TURN configuration handoff now favors value-style option snapshots instead of live mutable option bags
- Public option mutation is now explicit on package-manager surfaces via `mutableOptions()`, while the public AV encoder interfaces expose const option views
- `PeerSession::Config` now exposes media settings under `config.media`, and answer-session media options are derived explicitly from the remote offer's mids, directions, and payload types instead of relying on looser implicit defaults
- Symple client/server internals are now organized under `src/symple/src/client/` and `src/symple/src/server/`, with shared wire helpers in `src/symple/src/protocol.*`
- API reference coverage has been deepened across the core modules, WebRTC, and the pacm/pluga surfaces, with reorganized Sourcey guides and workflows
- icey docs now consume published `moxygen` / `sourcey` npm releases instead of git-pinned or exact-pinned toolchain versions
- Packaging assets are centralized under `packaging/` instead of spreading Conan and vcpkg files across the repo root
- Installed `icey.pc` metadata now uses the current package-manager-facing description instead of the old networking-only tagline
- Browser support claims are now explicit:
  - Chromium and Firefox are validated by the committed Playwright smoke
  - Playwright WebKit on Linux is treated as non-authoritative for Safari/WebRTC publish-path claims

### Fixed

- Exported CMake package consumers now tolerate dependency target-name differences across FetchContent, Conan, and vcpkg installs
- Repo-local Conan and vcpkg packaging validation now passes sequentially, and installed `icey.h` headers no longer leak absolute build/source paths
- Browser media-server smoke harness failures and related WebRTC sample pipeline regressions that were blocking stricter interop coverage
- Symple-backed WebRTC signalling now enforces full `user|id` peer identity on the public call boundary instead of accepting ambiguous bare user/session forms
- WebRTC receive-side codec detection no longer stringifies track descriptions back into SDP just to rediscover codec/clock data on bind or record paths
- Symple clients now transition cleanly to `Error` on underlying transport failures, including initial WebSocket connect failures, via explicit `http::ClientConnection` error propagation
- pacm JSON handling in the submodule update path, keeping the external package-manager surface aligned with the current docs/API snapshots

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- Dedicated protocol fuzz targets under `BUILD_FUZZERS` for the HTTP parser, WebSocket frame parser, STUN message parser, and TURN indication/request parsing
- Build-tree and install-tree consumer validation for the exported CMake package surface
- Dedicated microbenchmark targets under `BUILD_BENCHMARKS`: `signalbench`, `httpbench`, `httpparsebench`, and `wsbench`, plus the separate `BUILD_PERF` `httpperf`/`httpperf_compare` wrk/Node.js/Go comparison harness
- WebRTC loopback/media regression coverage for:
  - data-channel roundtrip
  - encoded H.264 roundtrip
  - encoded Opus roundtrip
  - relay audio fanout
  - relay source handoff
- `media-server` `record` and `relay` modes are now real shipped behaviors rather than placeholder sample code

### Changed

- HTTP benchmark assets moved out of `src/http/samples/httpbenchmark/` into `src/http/perf/`, while `src/http/bench/` now stays microbench-only and `src/http/samples/` contains samples only
- `PacketStream` queue retention and ownership semantics are now explicit at queue boundaries, with deterministic overload/drop accounting and synchronized multi-source passthrough
- `PeerSession` now uses explicit call phases and stricter signaling ordering, and WebRTC track setup requires explicit codec selection instead of fallback codec guessing
- The canonical WebRTC send path used by the samples and `media-server` is now encode -> RTP packetize -> sender, with stable sender bindings across call lifecycles

### Fixed

- Core async lifetime handling in `base` / `net` / `http`, including retained handle/request context, state-driven HTTP server lifecycle, and typed WebSocket parse errors
- STUN/TURN protocol correctness and relay hot paths:
  - correct STUN length/integrity patching
  - correct plain vs XOR address handling
  - IPv6 address attribute wire sizing
  - binary/numeric TURN permission checks and local-IP policy
- Symple routing/state correctness:
  - presence canonicalization
  - room-based authz checks
  - reconnect room restoration
  - virtual-peer copy semantics
- `media-server` relay/signaling behavior:
  - remote ICE candidates queue until remote SDP is installed
  - relay source promotion/handoff works correctly
  - stable media sender lifetime across attach/detach
- Package consumer discovery:
  - exported targets work correctly from both the build tree and install tree
  - `find_package(icey REQUIRED COMPONENTS ...)` correctly marks built components as found

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- Symple v4 server hardening: max connections, per-peer rate limiting (token bucket), max message size, graceful shutdown broadcast with error responses (413/429/503)
- Team/group permission scoping: rooms as permission boundaries, `rooms` field in auth message, `Authenticate` signal passes mutable `rooms` vector for server-side assignment
- Direct message permission check: sender and recipient must share at least one room
- Protocol version in welcome message (`"protocol": "symple/4"`) and room list in welcome response
- ASAN CMake support: `-fsanitize=address` propagates to FetchContent C dependencies via `CMAKE_C_FLAGS`
- `http::Server` overloads accepting `net::TCPSocket::Ptr` for TLS/SSL support alongside `uv::Loop*` constructors
- `smpl::Server` accepts `uv::Loop*` parameter, threads loop through to `http::Server`
- Timer destructor calls `stop()`, timer callback null-checks `req->data` (defense-in-depth)
- `Peer::operator=` with explicit `static_cast<const json::Value&>` (avoids nlohmann template overload)
- Symple module README with server, client, WebRTC signalling, and permissions documentation
- 4 hardening tests: max connections, max message size, rate limiting, graceful shutdown

### Fixed

- Mutex deadlock in `Responder::onPayload`: `connection().close()` for close/auth-reject was called inside the lock; moved to `shouldClose` flag pattern outside lock scope
- Use-after-free in `Server::onConnectionClose`: non-pooled connections were destroyed synchronously during their own callback chain; now deferred via idle callback (found by ASAN)
- `expect()` macro silently skipped side effects in `NDEBUG` mode: `waitFor()` calls inside `expect()` were never executed in Release builds

### Changed

- `http::Server` primary constructor takes `uv::Loop*` instead of `net::TCPSocket::Ptr`; loop is stored as `_loop` member, used in shutdown and deferred destruction
- SympleSignaller and all WebRTC samples updated from `smpl::TCPClient`/`SSLClient` to `smpl::Client`

### Removed

- `socketio` module deleted entirely (replaced by Symple v4 native WebSocket protocol)
- All `socketio` references removed from CMakeLists.txt across symple, webrtc samples

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added - WebRTC Module

- WebRTC module with [libdatachannel](https://github.com/nicertz/libdatachannel) integration (no Google libwebrtc dependency)
- Three-layer architecture: track factories (layer 1), per-track PacketStream adapters (layer 2), MediaBridge + PeerSession convenience wrappers (layer 3)
- Transport-agnostic `SignallingInterface` abstract base class; PeerSession no longer depends on Symple
- `SympleSignaller`: Symple call protocol implementation (call:init/accept/reject/offer/answer/candidate/hangup)
- Four WebRTC sample applications: data-echo, webcam-streamer, file-streamer, media-recorder
- `CodecNegotiator` maps RTP codecs to FFmpeg encoders at runtime
- CI job for WebRTC builds (Ubuntu 24.04, gcc-14, FFmpeg + OpenSSL + libdatachannel)

### Added - Symple v4

- Symple v4 protocol: native WebSocket transport replacing Socket.IO (breaking change from v3)
- C++ Symple server: auth, rooms, routing, presence, shutdown lifecycle
- C++ Symple client: plain WebSocket, auth flow, reconnection, close guard
- Protocol spec (`PROTOCOL.md`): connection lifecycle, message types, addressing, rooms, auth modes, scaling, v3-v4 migration
- 14 integration tests (address, peer, message, presence, roster, server lifecycle, connect, two-peer presence, message routing, auth failure, disconnect presence)
- `test::waitFor()` helper for event-driven async test patterns

### Added - HTTP Performance

- `ConnectionPool`: LIFO stack reuses ServerConnection objects across requests (configurable max size, default 128)
- `ServerConnection::reset()`: swap sockets without reconstruction (zero-alloc steady state)
- `DateCache`: formatted Date header updated once per second via timer
- HTTP/1.1 keep-alive: persistent connections, parser resets via `on_message_begin`, idle timeout (default 30s)
- `IntrusivePtr<T>` and `RefCounted<T>`: intrusive smart pointer with non-atomic embedded refcount (zero allocation overhead vs shared_ptr)
- Go net/http server added to benchmark suite for comparison
- Pre-formatted static status lines for common HTTP codes

### Added - Other

- `USE_SYSTEM_DEPS` CMake option for vcpkg/system package integration (switches FetchContent to find_package for libuv, llhttp, zlib, minizip)
- Vendored nlohmann/json single header (v3.11.3), eliminating FetchContent download
- vcpkg port with full dependency manifest and feature flags
- Symplestreamer sample: camera/file video streaming to symple-player via MJPEG over WebSocket
- HTTP benchmark suite and performance section in README
- `SO_REUSEPORT` support via `Server::setReusePort()` for multicore HTTP serving
- `NullSharedMutex` and `LocalSignal` for lock-free signal dispatch on single-threaded event loops
- `ICY_DATA_DIR` compile definition for test/sample data paths

### Changed

- `Handle::Context` changed from `shared_ptr` to `unique_ptr` (sole ownership, eliminates control block allocation per handle)
- `Handle::Context::~Context` clears `handle->data = nullptr` before `uv_close` to prevent use-after-free in pending callbacks
- `Stream::write` callback null-checks `handle->data` before accessing the Stream object
- `http::Server::shutdown()` defers connection destruction via `uv_idle` callback (prevents write callback use-after-free)
- `smpl::Server::shutdown()` uses `_shuttingDown` atomic flag to guard Responder callbacks during destruction
- `smpl::Client::close()` uses `_closing` guard to prevent re-entrant close
- Symple client no longer depends on socketio module; uses native WebSocket via HTTP module
- WebRTC module `DEPENDS` drops symple (signalling is transport-agnostic)
- `SKIP_EXPORT` option added to `icy_add_module` for FetchContent dependency conflicts
- README rewritten: WebRTC hero example, comparison table vs libWebRTC/libdatachannel/GStreamer/Pion, architecture diagram, module table
- Conan recipe added with per-module components and optional FFmpeg/OpenCV features

- `string_view`: converted ~270 read-only `const std::string&` parameters across base, http, crypto, net, symple, av, json, stun, turn modules
- `random`: rewrote PRNG with `std::mt19937` + `std::random_device`, replacing BSD nonlinear additive feedback LFSR
- `datetime`: rewrote internals with C++20 `std::chrono` calendar types (`year_month_day`, `sys_days`, `weekday`), replacing Julian Day floating-point math
- `numeric`: rewrote sprintf-based number formatting with `std::to_chars`, consolidated 50 functions into shared templates
- `util`: replaced 10 `icompare` template overloads (~140 lines) with single `string_view` implementation
- Renamed `json::value` to `json::Value` for codebase consistency
- HTTP server connections container changed from `vector` to `unordered_map` for O(1) lookup
- Single-pass response header assembly with pre-computed reserve

- `uv_write_t` request pooling via freelist in Stream (avoids heap alloc per write)
- Static status code string lookup in `Response::write`
- Cached peer address after connect (avoids repeated `uv_tcp_getpeername` calls)
- Modernised all sample applications
- Moved test data (`test.mp4`) to top-level `data/` directory shared across modules
- Refreshed README with contributors section, moved build/contributing docs to `docs/`

### Fixed

- `sendHeader()` undefined behavior: response buffer moved from local to member (local `std::string` was freed before async `uv_write` completed)
- `UV_EOF` in `Stream::handleRead()` now triggers graceful close instead of error state
- Symple v4 client `Peer` to json assignment needed `static_cast<const json::Value&>` to avoid nlohmann `type_error.302`

- `json::findNestedObjectWithProperty` was comparing `it.value()` instead of `it.key()`
- `Configuration::removeAll` iterator invalidation
- `LogStream` stub destructor for `ENABLE_LOGGING=OFF` builds
- `httpclient` sample `StatusCode` enum streaming

### Removed

- WebRTC hard dependency on Symple (signalling is now pluggable via `SignallingInterface`)
- Stale `bench/` directory (duplicate of `src/http/samples/httpbenchmark`)
- Dead commented-out JsonCpp stringify code in json module
- Empty `json.cpp` stub
- Deprecated `thread.h`/`thread.cpp` and `archo` test file
- In-source build artifacts

- archo: Compressed/uncompressed file size fields were swapped
- base: once.h missing uv_close() on prepare handle (resource leak)
- base: UV_EOF in Stream::handleRead() now triggers graceful close instead of error state (fixes shutdown() causing spurious errors)
- base: IPC waitForSync() now has configurable timeout (default 5s) preventing infinite hangs
- base: Signal slot ID uniqueness enforced, throws on collision
- base: DateTime constructor/assign validate all components at runtime (was assert-only)
- base: PacketStream destructor warns instead of asserting on non-terminal state
- base: TaskRunner::add() fixed stray semicolon bug that allowed duplicate task insertion
- crypto: EVP_md5 replaced with EVP_sha256 for cipher key derivation
- av: MediaCapture::run() fixed stray semicolon on looping seek (was a no-op)
- av: MultiplexEncoder PTS tracking now mutex-protected across audio/video paths
- av: MediaCapture flags (_stopping, _looping, etc.) changed to std::atomic for thread safety
- av: FFmpeg 6.x const AVOutputFormat compatibility (removed oformat->codec assignment)
- av: Unchecked FFmpeg return values now checked: avformat_write_header, av_write_trailer, avio_close, avcodec_parameters_from_context
- http: Download progress tracking re-enabled via ClientConnection::IncomingProgress signal
- http: WebSocket RFC 6455 compliance: RSV bit validation, opcode validation, mask enforcement, ping/pong auto-response, close frame handshake
- http: WebSocket partial frame buffering across TCP segments
- http: WebSocket fragmentation/continuation frame support
- net: SSLContext min proto version was set before null check on context (crash fix)
- net: SSLAdapter SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE now calls flushWriteBIO instead of asserting
- pacm: latestSDKAsset() logic simplified (dead code branch removed)
- sched: Scheduler::update() and run() memory leaks fixed (erased tasks without deleting)

### Production safety

- All `assert()` calls in production source code replaced with runtime checks (throws, returns, or warnings) - approximately 110+ asserts across 30 files in base, net, av, crypto, pacm modules
- All stale `#if 0` dead code blocks removed across 13+ source files
- Stream::write() backpressure via configurable high water mark on libuv write queue (default 16MB)
- TaskRunner ownership modernised: `std::deque<std::unique_ptr<Task>>` replaces raw pointer container

### Module changes

- util module merged into base (headers moved, includes updated, downstream deps fixed)
- archo module updated to use `std::filesystem::path`
- Socket.IO protocol v5 compatibility verified
- FindFFmpeg.cmake rewritten to use pkg-config (old version depended on deleted CMake macros)
- pacm and pluga modules fully modernised (noexcept destructors, dead code removed, typos fixed)

### Tests

- base: Timer pause/resume, timer one-shot, IPC round-trip, logger level filtering, PacketStream overflow
- av: Standalone VideoEncoder (synthetic YUV -> libx264), VideoDecoder (test.mp4), AudioDecoder (test.mp4)
- http: Request/response serialisation round-trip, POST request, WebSocket text/binary frame encoding, client masking, control frames
- pacm: Package JSON round-trip, asset version selection, LocalPackage state management, manifest operations, error handling, InstallationState strings

### Removed

- WebRTC module (unmaintainable due to Google API churn)
- Deprecated code: `av/deprecated/`, `UserManager`, `SharedObject`
- Dead connection classes from http/client.h
- CircleCI configuration
- Gitbook documentation tooling
- Vendored libuv, zlib, http-parser sources
- Legacy Poco and Anionu dependencies
